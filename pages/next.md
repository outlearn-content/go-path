# What to do next

You now know enough to be dangerous, what next? Here are two awesome resources to continue your journey with Goland:

* [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com). This has lots of bite-sized nuggets on Go.
* [Gobridge training](https://github.com/gobridge/gotraining). The materials here are built for instructor-led training but they are also super helpful for a self-guided learner.

I want to keep on making this Learning Path better. Let me know about any feedback using the widget on the right.

Go forth with Go!
