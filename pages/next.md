# What to do next

You now know enough to be dangerous, what next? Here are two awesome resources to continue your journey with Go:

* [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com). This has lots of bite-sized nuggets on Go.
* [Building Web Apps with Go](https://codegangsta.gitbooks.io/building-web-apps-with-go/content/). Great book that gets more into the details of using Go.

I want to keep on making this Learning Path better. Let me know if you have any feedback by using the widget on the right.

Go forth with Go!
