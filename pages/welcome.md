# Welcome to Golang Crash Course

Go continues to pick up steam for projects large and small. If you've been wanting to get your hands dirty and build some Go code yourself, this is the Path for you!

We'll start with a brief video from Rob Pike, one of Go's creators. He gives a concise intro to the strengths of Go. Next, we have a link to the official tour which does a great job introducing the basics as well as letting you play with them real time. Then we'll take a closer look into the go command and how to use it in your development workflow.

We'll wrap up the first part of the path with handy examples from Learn Go in Y Minutes.

Good luck with your Go journey!
